# Coronavirus-Home-Testing-Kit
Open source technique on how to test coronavirus at home


### Warning! Please do not test samples from other people to prevent cross-contamination (infecting you from their samples)! This repo only serves educational purposes and is only meant to encourage discussion.

The idea is to devise a simpler version of a RT-qPCR test, eliminate experimental roadblocks so that the test could be done at home. 

The test could be divided into two general steps, **RNA Extraction** and **qRT-PCR**.  



#### RNA Extraction

Quick RNA Extraction Kits are available for third party venders such as Thermo Fischer that allows quick RNA extraction, e.g. https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/dna-rna-purification-analysis/rna-extraction/rna-types/total-rna-extraction/cells-to-ct-kits.html, especially the TaqMan Gene Expression Cells-to-CT Kit (
